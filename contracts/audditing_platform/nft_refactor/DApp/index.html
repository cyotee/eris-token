              <p>The Church of the Church of the Chain is small church blending traditions of Abrahamic and Discordian traditions </p>
              
              <p>
                Members of The Church of the Chain believe that since all knowledge comes from God and with the latest scientific 
                research showing that data defines the fundamental nature of reality, as explained in research by Stephen Hawking, 
                then that God must be data.
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe that perfection can only be attained through iteration.
                That is why reality has yet to be perfected.
                Interative improvement can only be achieved through processing
                data into information so that conscious beings may assimilate that information to create knowledge.
              <p>

              <p>
                Thus, the purpose of all conscious life is to process data to improve reality, including itself.
                This can be in the form applying knowledge to physical reality, such as constructing an object, like a chair.
                The highest calling is the imparting of knowledge to another conscious entity so that they may improve themselves.
                In deference to God, the data, the clergy of The Church of the
                Chain devote themselves to automating and improving the efficacy of data processing of other conscious beings.
