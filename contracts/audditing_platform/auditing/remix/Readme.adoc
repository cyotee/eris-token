This is not meant for production as there is a lot of duplicated code pasted directly into each file to make imports not be a pain.
This is meant for QA testing as parts may not function as desired.

Here are the steps to use this in remix.

1) In remix load the files: AuditNFT, Datastore, Platform & ToDo
2) In the plugin manager (found in the left panel depicted by a plug) find the plugins
	Debugger 
	Deploy & run transactions
	Compiler
	(May add the gas profiler too if you want to use that)
3) In the Compile section compile each of the contracts, default settings should be fine
4) In the Deploy section 
	Set the Environment to JavaScript VM
	Increase the gas limit to be 6 million
	Deployment: (you may need to compile each time to the file you want to deploy to get the box to switch its options)
		In the CONTRACT box select
			AuditNFT - browser/AuditNFT.sol (then click deploy)
			Datastore - browser/Datastore.sol (then click deploy)
			Platform - browser/Platform.sol (takes 2 arguments which are the addresses of the deployed Audit NFT, Datastore, after that click deploy)
			Copy the address of the platform and in the Datastore use the function transferOwnership with that address
			Do the same for the Audit NFT with the platform address
			ToDo - browser/ToDo.sol (takes 2 arguments which are the addresses of the auditor and the platform, for the auditor copy the address of the first account in the ACCOUNT box which is above the gas limit, the platform address is the same as the one you transferred ownership with)
			
5) To use the ToDo.sol you must set the hash with setContractCreationHash() and an address, I usually use the same one as the account address that I'm using for the auditor (then approve the contract but first step 6)

6) In the Platform.sol you must addAuditor with the address of whoever is set in the ToDo.sol as the auditor

To unlock the ToDo you must approve the contract.
